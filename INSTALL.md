```
more options show in **build_options.sh**, you can choose the compile options by yourself.

```
cat build_options.sh
```

when compile done, then use this to install:

```
sudo sh build.sh install
```

if you want to build release version, use this:

```

```

then install release version topio, use this:

```

then run topio:
